# Limit pull requests GitHub Action

An action that limits the number of open pull requests to the repository created
by a user.

## Prerequisites

- [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://github.com/cli/cli) and
  [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) need to be installed.
- These permissions need to be set:

  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: read
    pull-requests: write
  ```

## Usage

This action should be used in a `pull_request_target` workflow.

```yaml
- uses: Homebrew/actions/limit-pull-requests@main
  with:
    except-users: |
      BrewTestBot
    # https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#commentauthorassociation

    comment-limit: 10
    comment: >
      You already have 10 pull requests open. Please consider working on getting
      the existing ones merged before opening new ones. Thanks!
